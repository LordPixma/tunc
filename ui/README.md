# Magic Patterns - Vite Template

This code was generated by [Magic Patterns](https://magicpatterns.com) for this design: [Source Design](https://www.magicpatterns.com/c/sqzj9gnumdiqymcifnsbl5)

## Getting Started

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run dev`

## Environment Variables

Create `.env` files to configure the API endpoint used by the UI. Variables must be prefixed with `VITE_` to be exposed in the browser.

For development, create a `.env` (or `.env.development`) file:

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8787"
```

For a production build, create a `.env.production` file with the deployed API URL:

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL="https://your-api.example.com"
```

If `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is omitted, the app falls back to relative paths and logs a warning in the console.

## Build and Serve Public UI

1. Run `npm run build:public` to output the production build to `../public/ui`.
2. Serve the built files from `../public/ui` using any static file server, for example `npx serve ../public/ui`.
